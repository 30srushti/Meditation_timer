## 🌿 Built  21-Minute Meditation Timer

Sticking to a fixed **21-minute meditation routine** was always challenging for me.
Each segment has a different duration —
**7 min Suka Kriya → 7 min OM Kara → 3 min Fast Breathing → 1 min Bandhas → 3 min Relaxation**,
and I often found myself losing track of time.

So, instead of struggling every day…
👉 I built a simple web-based meditation timer for myself!

✨ What it does:

* Runs each meditation segment automatically
* Gives a **2-second beep** at the end of each step
* Plays a calming 3-minute relaxation audio at the end
* Works directly on my phone
* Shows a clean interface with a meditation image
* Helps me stay fully focused without checking the clock.
